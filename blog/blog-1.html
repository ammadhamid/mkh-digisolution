        <h1>How to Create a Google Search Ads Campaign</h1> <br> 
        <p>
          Our data-focused Google Ads services have been discussed a lot about
          how powerful Google Search Ads can increase your brand awareness and
          conversions at an unprecedented pace. <br />
          Having these results is great, but you must know how to design those
          campaigns to achieve them. <br />
          Search ad creation can be easier than you think. You must know what to
          expect and how your decisions affect your strategy. <br />
          Are you ready to learn how to create a Google Search Ads campaign to
          promote your brand? Continue reading to learn everything you need to.
          <br />
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>Setting Up Your Google Ads Account</h3> <br>
        <p>
          You'll need a few things done before starting your ad campaign. You
          can create a Google Ads Account if you do not already have one. This
          is free, fast and simple. You can do it <a href="">here</a>. <br />
          You'll need a few details to run ads once your account has been
          created. These include: Setting up a payment method. Google will
          charge you when your campaigns start attracting clicks. Go to "Tools
          and Settings" and then "Billing." Click "Settings", which is located
          under it.
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>Understanding the Google Search Ads Campaign Structure</h3> <br> 
        <p>
          It's important to understand the structure of an ad campaign before we
          get into creating a Google Search Ads Campaign. <br />
          The campaign is broken into several ad groupings, each with multiple
          ads below. You can choose keywords for individual ad groups that will
          not affect the other ad groups but will impact each ad below. It works
          the same for ad group keywords. You can set them for an individual ad
          group that won't affect the others but will impact each ad in the
          individual group. <br />
          You can use this to organize your account and make managing ads
          easier. Ad groups can test or target different keyword strategies, ads
          and ad copies. All without having to set up the basic campaign
          information repeatedly.
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>Before You Start</h3> <br> 
        <p>
          We promise that we're nearly done with the weeds and can now move on
          to the main setup of your campaign. You'll need to: <br />
          What is the goal of your campaign? How many clicks do you want to get
          on your site? Sales? Phone calls? Phone calls? It doesn't matter, but
          You must know what you hope to achieve from the campaign. Otherwise,
          you'll become confused, overwhelmed and unfocused.<br />
          Prepare your keyword strategy & research. It's not the best time to
          experiment with keywords during campaign setup. You'll want to do your
          keyword research in advance and know what strategies you will use.<br />
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>How to Create a Google Search Ads Campaign</h3> <br> 
        <p>
          We've finally reached the point where you came to the chapter in the first
           instance: a detailed breakdown of how to create a Google Search Ads campaign.
          Let's go through the process step by step
          </p> <br> 
          <h4> Start in Your Dashboard</h6>  <br>
            <p>Sign in to Google Ads <a href="">here</a>. Your Google Ads dashboard
               should appear once you've logged in. You'll first see the Overview. 
               Click on the "+ New Campaign" CTA in the center of the screen to get
               started.</p> <br>
               <h3>Create Your Campaign</h3> <br>
               <p>The campaign level is a lot more flexible than Facebook Ads. It's 
                not all about the goal (which is the main focus on most social PPC platforms).
                Let's start creating your first campaign.
                </p> <br>
                <h3>Choose Your Objectives</h3> <br>
                <p>
                  The first thing we need to do is set the goals. Google will know 
                  what you're trying to achieve with your campaign.
                  Here are your options:<br/>
                  Sales are focused on driving sales online, by phone, in-store, or
                   through an app. <br/>
                  Leads are where the goal is to generate leads by capturing their 
                  email addresses. <br/>
                  Website Traffic focuses on getting visitors to your website. <br/>
                  Brand and product consideration: Where you want people to learn 
                  more about your offerings
                  Brand recognition and reach are a priority that prioritizes brand
                   name recognition and impressions. <br/>
                  App Promotion is a way to promote your app by aiming to increase 
                  installs, registrations or interactions (these will usually be more
                   mobile-focused for obvious reasons). <br/>
                  Local Store Visits and Promotions, which focuses on getting customers
                   to visit you in a brick-and-mortar location. <br/>
                  If you're new to Google Ads, we don't recommend creating a campaign 
                  without a goal. Google will adjust the campaign settings based on 
                  your chosen objective. <br/>
                  Leads are often the priority for service-based businesses. SaaS 
                  companies will push for free trials. eCommerce businesses also want
                   to make sales as soon as possible. Google will consider this, so 
                   you should do any additional internal optimization.
                  In this example, because so many of our customers have an eCommerce 
                  focus, we will choose "Sales." <br/>
                </p> <br>
                <h3>Select a Conversion Goal</h3> <br>
                <p>You'll then choose the specific goals you want to emphasize in your 
                  campaign. <br/>
                  We have set conversion goals for the "Sales' objective. These include 
                  a website purchase or a phone call from the ad. <br/>
                  Select the conversion goal that is most suitable for you and move on 
                  to the next section. <br/>
                  </p>
                  <h3>Click "Search Ads"</h3> <br>
                  <p>You'll then decide what ads to use to reach your goals. Since this 
                    Hub is about search ads, click "Search."</p> <br>
                  <h3>Set Goals & Name Your Campaign</h3> <br>
                  <p>You'll be asked to select the actions that count towards your goal.
                     You can choose from various options, including phone calls, app downloads,
                      website visits, and store visits.<br/>
                    <strong> Tip:</strong> If you have already set up conversions for your
                     campaign, there is no need to select any of these options. <br/> 
                    You'll then be asked to give your campaign a name. While this may seem
                     like a small detail, remember the following: <br/>
                    You don't want to default to the basic "Sales Search - 1"; instead, you'll
                     want to be more descriptive to make identifying and monitoring your campaign
                      easier. The "Appliance Fall Sale Campaigns" and the "Holiday Bundle Promotions" are more effective.
                    It is easier to name the campaign accurately if you know which ad group and
                     ads will be included. <br/>
                    If unsure where to begin, choose "Goal/Objective" or "Type of Ad, Identifying
                     Quality." Then, "Website Leads- Search- SaaS Brands" works well. <br/>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Select Your Budget</h3> <br>
                    <p>This is an important part of creating a campaign.<br/>
                      First, you'll need to determine your average daily budget. <br>
                      It is important to note that the budget for each day is "average," not "firm." <br>
                      It's just a number. Google will multiply your daily average budget by the 
                    number of days in a month. The ad budget will be below this number every month,
                     but you may spend more or less on some days. <br>
                      Remember that multiple campaigns may be run simultaneously when setting your
                     budget. Plan to know what you can afford for each campaign. You can always change it later. <br>
                      </p>  <br>
                      <h3>Choose Your Bid & Bid Strategy</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        The budget determines the total amount you will spend. Your bid strategy
                       and bid determines what you pay for and how much. <br>
                        Google will automatically recommend a bidding strategy based on your objectives
                       and goals. You can also let Google handle the bidding process if you prefer. 
                       You can set up different bidding parameters. <br>
                        For example, you can "set a cost-per-action target" using the "Maximize
                       Conversions" bid strategy. This bidding strategy, which is the default, is 
                       designed to maximize conversions within your budget. Setting a target cost for an action tells Google the average amount you will pay per action. <br>
                        Lower bids can mean you'll pay less, giving you more budget for additional
                       clicks. While these tools can help you keep your acquisition costs at the level
                        you require for profitability, they may also lower the quality of your clicks. <br>
                        You'll need to monitor the impact of your bid strategies and caps to ensure
                       they are helping your campaigns, not hurting them. 
                      </p> <br>
                      <h3>Choose Your Bid & Bid Strategy</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        The budget determines the total amount you will spend. Your bid strategy
                        and bid determines what you pay for and how much. <br/>

                      </p>
                      <h3>Customize the Ad Rotation Option</h3>
                      <p>
                        You'll see "More Settings," a drop-down menu, below the budget and bidding sections.
                        Clicking on the menu will reveal options for customizing ad rotation. <br/>
                        If you use the Ad Rotation feature, Google will know which ads will show you most frequently.
                        Optimize is the default setting that prioritizes and shows more of your best-performing ads. <br/>
                        You can also rotate your ads indefinitely and evenly, regardless of their performance.
                        This option does not optimize.
                        We recommend never touching this section and letting Google handle the heavy lifting.
                        There are only a few reasons why you should choose instead of when optimizing your website,
                        and none will apply here. Let's move on to the next part. <br/>
                      </p> <br>
                      <h3>Find out where your ads can appear.</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        You'll be asked where you would like your ads to appear on the next page.
                        <br/>
                        You don't need to worry because campaigns will be displayed in the relevant
                        search results. <br/>
                        The Search Network, as well as the Display Network, can be disabled. <br/>
                       <strong> Tip:</strong> Never enable Display Network for any Search campaign. Display Network
                        is completely different from Search. We recommend running a Display-only 
                        campaign if you wish to test out the Display Network. <br/>
                      </p> <br>
                      <h3>As a quick recap:</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        The search network consists of search engines that are located on third-party sites.
                        Users can either use the on-site Google Search or search the website. Ads can appear
                        when the user chooses the on-site Google Search. <br/>
                        The Display Network also includes placements on third-party publishers' sites.
                        You can use audience targeting or retargeting to make your video or visual ads
                        appear on those sites. <br/>
                      </p>
                      <h3>Select Your Audience</h3>
                      <p>
                      You can choose several options to let Google know who should see your ad.
                      You can increase an ad's relevance by showing it to only those users most
                      likely to convert.
                      You'll first be able to select the users you wish to target and their 
                      locations. <br>
                      There are many options when it comes to targeting the right audience.
                      You can select to target only people who live or visit your location regularly 
                      or who have searched it. <br>
                      Hotel ads, for instance, would not want to be limited to only those who
                      live in a particular area as they might miss their target audience. <br>
                      You can choose the audience segments you wish to target based on their
                      interests, demographics or purchasing behaviors.  <br>
                      You can select to show ads only to certain audience segments. However,
                      for most search ads, it is recommended that you use the "observation option,"
                      which does not limit your reach but allows you to bid higher on users. <br>
                    </p> <br>
                    <h3>Consider Dynamic Search Ads Settings</h3> <br>
                    <p>
                      Google's Google's dynamic search ads allow Google to target relevant queries
                      based on content on your website. They'll use headlines that will be customized
                      to people's requests. <br> 
                      If DSA is the option you choose, you will be asked to enter your domain name and
                      select a target audience.
                    </p> <br>
                    <h3>Select Day Parting Options and Ad Scheduling Options</h3> <br>
                    <p>
                      The last part of creating a campaign is almost complete! <br>
                      Additional customization options are available under the "More Settings Tab" on this screen. <br>
                      You may choose a start date and an end date for your ads. Otherwise, they will run automatically
                      once you approve them until you manually stop the ads. Scheduled ads are only recommended for
                      time-sensitive campaigns, such as those promoting limited-time sales or offers. <br>
                      You can also set a schedule for your ads. For those who are familiar with the term, this is dayparting. <br> You can choose when your ad runs.
                    </p> <br>
                    <h3>Add Keywords in Your Ad Group</h3> <br>
                    <p>The ad-group stage has finally arrived! <br>
                      You can add keywords to the ad group on the next page. <br>
                      You can let Google suggest keywords, but we recommend researching beforehand. <br>
                      You can also select your keyword match type and enter any negative keywords you don't wish to rank for.
                      </p> <br>
                      <h3>Create Your Ads</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        Once you've created your keywords, the next step is to create the ads. <br>
                        Google requires that you use multiple headlines, as you can see in the image below.
                        Adding additional headlines to your page gives them more options to test and see what
                        works best for driving clicks and your desired actions. <br>
                        Check the preview to see if there are any errors or if you can improve the formatting. <br>
                        You can spot small improvements or add more keywords by reading your created ad. <br>
                        At this point, you can also consider advanced HTML features such as dynamic keyword inserts,
                        countdowns, or location inserts. <br>
                        We've got a whole guide on Google Ads Extensions. Here's a quick summary: <br>
                        Extensions allow you to add extra content to an advertisement
                        This extra content is designed to increase clicks, actions or conversions
                        Some can be used to drive immediate non-click action, such as call extensions or lead extensions, while others take up more room and add more context 
                        Select which extensions you would like to add to campaigns (Google will decide when to add extensions to your campaign and which extensions to add). <br>
                        Add as many relevant extensions to Google as possible to give them plenty of options.]
                      </p> <br>
                      <h3>Review Your Ad Campaigns</h3> <br>
                      <p>It's time to review the entire campaign from top to bottom. <br>
                        Double-check everything. Check that you have targeted the correct
                        zip codes and that your copy is error-free. <br>
                        Submit it and wait for Google's approval before the ad can run! <br>
                        </p> <br>
                        <h3>How To Edit Your Campaigns</h3> <br>

                          To edit the campaign, click on the one you wish to edit. Then select settings. <br>
                          Find the specific features that you want to modify and then proceed. <br>
                          </p> <br>
