        <h1>How the Google Ads Auction Works</h1> <br> 
        <p>
            Google Ads works like other <a style="color: #a11d20;" href="../subpages/smm/google-ppc/ppc.html"><strong> PPC</strong></a>
            platforms based on an auction. <br> 
            You've probably heard this a lot when you learn about Google Ads:
            consider bidding strategies, costs, and options for optimization.
             <br />
             What does it all mean? What is the process, and how can advertisers get better placements and more clicks to increase their placements?
             We'll look closer at the Google Ads Auction and see what it means to advertisers.
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>What is the Google Ads Auction?</h3> <br>
        <p>
            Google Ads Auctions are a system where multiple advertisers "bid"
             against each other for certain keywords and ad positions. <br />
             You may get a click today on your <a href="./blog-1.html"><strong style="color: #a11d20;">Campaign</strong></a>
             for $1.50 but pay $1.75 an hour later for the same click. For example, you
             may pay $1.50 for a click on your campaign today and $1.75 for a similar 
             click an hour later.
             You're bidding against not only your direct competitors but all other advertisers competing for the same placements as you. <br/>
             When you create an ad, you can set the bid including target bids, bid caps and more. Google considers this factor when deciding
             which ads will be placed. You can set a daily budget. <br/>
            Other factors also play a role. Ads that fit the criteria are given priority. Ads that have higher scores and higher bids are
            given priority. Both factors are powerful and can help you dominate impression shares. <br/>
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>Is Bid the Same Thing as Budget?</h3> <br> 
        <p>
            The terms "budget" and "bid" are often used interchangeably. However,
            they are two distinct concepts. <br />
            The budget and bid are not the same. <br>
            Your bid will determine the amount you will spend on certain actions.
            For example, you can set a maximum bid of $2.30. You will never pay 
            more than $2.30 for a click. <br>
            You can set a "target" cost per action. You can set a limit of $2.30
            for each action. As long as the average is within that amount, it's okay to go over. You can still get some high-quality clicks and stick to your set costs. <br>
            Budget is the amount of money you will spend daily on your campaign.
            Google has a set limit that you can change at any time. <br>
            Both your budget and bid will impact the placement of your ads. If 
            you bid more, you may get more placements or those with higher visibility. <br>
            Budgets are consumed faster when the bid is higher. Higher bids will
            require a larger budget if you want to capture a significant portion of the impressions. <br>
            Both can be used as a way to control your spending. The higher they
            are, the more likely you will get quality placements. <br>
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>What Factors Influence the Google Ads Auction?</h3> <br> 
        <p>
            We've already discussed a few of the key factors that affect Google Ads.
            Budget and bidding are important. All else equal, someone who bids more
            will get better or more placements. If you have more money, you can appear
            in more places. You may rank higher than your competitors, but they finish
            their $200 budget by midday. With your $600 budget per day, you can dominate the rest.
            <br/>
            Google also looks at other factors, such as the landing page and the quality of an ad, to determine how well it fits with the different ads. Ads with a higher Quality Score get a priority placement and preferential treatment. They may even have their ads displayed at a lower bid. <br>
            We have a complete guide for those unfamiliar with Goole Ads Quality Score. Here's the gist.
Google's Quality Score tells you the perceived relevance of your ads by users.
This includes: <br>
<span style="color: #a11d20;"> ❖ </span>	Your ad text should include the keyword or seem relevant <br>
<span style="color: #a11d20;"> ❖ </span>	CTR (Click-through rate): Current and historical CTR <br>
<span style="color: #a11d20;"> ❖ </span>	The landing page quality and how well it matches the advertisement. <br>
<span style="color: #a11d20;"> ❖ </span>	Performance of devices by type <br>
Small businesses may have no chance of ranking when larger companies with strong scores in quality and large budgets dominate the rankings. It's good to know that this is not the case. <br>
There's plenty of space to achieve great placements. While established businesses might be able to appear on many of the top listings, there is still room for improvement. It's all about the right bid, strategy and copy/keyword combination. We have helped our clients do this on different keywords to increase their visibility and get relevant, quality clicks.

        <h3>4 Things You Need to Know About the Google Ads Auction</h3> <br> 
        <p>
            There are four things that all brands and advertisers should know about the Google Ads Auction before they start running Google Ads:
            It is almost impossible to achieve 100% of the share of impressions; you won't see it very often unless you are looking at a keyword
            with a low volume and low competition or your brand keywords. Your ad will not appear every time. That's okay. It's okay as long as the results are generated at a profitable cost. <br>
            Your bid will only cost a fraction of what your competitors would pay. It is not necessary to pay the entire amount. You may have bid $2.30 but still get much lower results. Google won't nickel and dime your bid; this is not a negotiation. <br>
            The bidding strategy you choose can significantly impact what you pay for and how much you pay. You must choose your bid strategy carefully, as it will impact what you pay for, how much, and your placement quality. We'll discuss this topic in more detail in a future blog post. <br>
            Things change. Although many keywords show relatively consistent trends for long periods (sometimes even multiple years), it is important to remember that the market changes. It can indicate that your pricing may fluctuate, or your impression share will drop. You might need to re-evaluate. This is an auction so that you can play. Close monitoring will ensure that you remain competitive and relevant.
        </p> <br> 
          <h4>Final Thoughts</h6>  <br>
            <p>
                Google Ads Auctions are dynamic, and they change as the market evolves.
                The market can change at any moment. New keywords may gain or lose 
                popularity, competitors could enter the market, offers might be introduced,
                and consumer behavior and competitor behavior could shift. This can have
                a rapid impact on the Auction. <br>
                It's vital to monitor your campaigns frequently because the Auction is dynamic.
                Creating rules can help you keep track of any changes to your campaign. However,
                nothing beats a manual review and management. <br>
                Remember that Google Ads are a process of trial and error. You may need to 
                experiment for a while before finding the best combination of budget, bid
                and ad that gets you quality clicks or leads at the desired price. It would
                help if you regularly allocated a portion of your advertising budget to A/B tests. <br>
