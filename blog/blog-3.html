        <h1>How to make money on TikTok: 15 strategies to use in 2024</h1> <br> 
        <p>
            Since its launch, TikTok remains a popular social media platform. People
            are drawn to its short, light-hearted content. TikTok's popularity is
            increasing, which means it offers much revenue potential. Your TikTok
            Marketing Strategy needs to take advantage of this. <br>
            Brands use creative and authentic methods to sell and position their
            products and services to TikTok audiences, from the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt
            hashtag to subcultures such as #BookTok. Make engaging, helpful videos
            tailored to your audience's interests. <br>
            Where do you start? This article outlines the 15 best ways to earn money
            with TikTok. It has been updated to reflect the changes to the creator
            funds announced in November 2023.
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>1.Join the TikTok Creativity Program/ 
        Creator Fund</h3> <br>
        <p>
            TikTok's most popular creators have been able to monetize their content since 2020. TikTok will announce changes in November 2023, depending on your location. TikTok will be shutting down its Creator Fund in the US, UK and France and replacing it, starting December 16, with the Creativity Programme. <br />
            TikTok claims that the new fund allows creators to earn more money by uploading videos longer than a minute. To be eligible, users must have 100,000 views and 10,000 followers in the past 30 days. Views and TikTok engagement metrics will be used to determine earnings. <br>
            Are you a creator from Italy or Spain? These users can still monetize profiles via the TikTok creator fund. To join the program, creators must meet specific requirements. Creator Fund members are paid based on how many people engage with their content. <br>
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>2.Run TikTok ads</h3> <br> 
        <p>
            67% of TikTok users are 18-19-year-olds, and 56% are 20-29. This makes TikTok Marketing an excellent advertising option for brands looking to market to Gen Z. TikTok Ads are simple and powerful tools that help you reach millions of users. The ad formats differ by region, but they allow you to personalize your targeting based on age, location and interest. Select one or more formats that are most effective for your brand. <br />
            TikTok advertisements are most commonly used for: <br>
            <strong>Infeed Video: </strong>Appear on the For You Page for TikTok users that meet your targeting parameters. <br> 
            <strong>Brand Takeover: </strong>  Your ad will expand to fill the entire screen for a few seconds. It then becomes a video in-feed ad. <br>
            <strong>Hashtag Challenges: </strong> Create challenges that are appealing to encourage user-generated material. These challenges are displayed in the Discovery section of TikTok. This option is available only to brands managed by TikTok representatives in collaboration. <br>
            You can try out several other TikTok advertisements, but be aware that some are only available for certain accounts. 
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>3.	Collecting tips or donations</h3> <br> 
        <p>
            TikTok's new tipping feature allows certain creators to make money through tips and donations. This feature will enable fans to express gratitude to the creators they admire. <br>
            Video gifts allow viewers to send virtual coins and gifts to creators. Some creators are able to collect gifts while they're live-streaming. Diamonds, TikTok's currency digitally, can be exchanged for gifts. <br>
            You can exchange your Diamonds for real money when you have enough. <br>
            Creators can use tip platforms to make money. Tipeee Ko-fi Buy Me a Coffee, and Tipeee can be linked to your TikTok to act as tip jars. <br>
        </p> <br> 
        <h3>4.	Collaboration with a creator</h3> <br> 
        <p>
            According to the latest Sprout Index (tm), 33% of Gen Z and 28% of Millennials are interested in brand/creator collaborations. TikTok has a thriving content creator, making it an excellent channel for collaborating with influential people in highly engaged communities. <br>
            Creator-made content is 83% more engaging. <br>
            TikTok’s creator marketplace allows you to connect with other content creators. You can run campaigns and find influencers in just a few clicks. Find creators according to your business goals, budget, and industry. You can also see performance and audience metrics to help you make data-driven decisions. <br>
            TikTok's Creator Marketplace has specific eligibility requirements; only selected creators can join. This ensures that the creators with whom marketers partner are among TikTok’s most influential users. <br>
            
          </p> <br> 
          <h4> 5.	Affiliate marketing is a great way to promote your business.</h6>  <br>
            <p>Affiliate marketing allows creators to promote and sell the products and services of another company in exchange for a commission.
              <br>
              You need to make sales online to be a successful Affiliate Marketer. Promote products that are most relevant to your audience. Create videos that showcase affiliate products, their value, and why you recommend buying them. Share affiliate codes or links to track the purchases that you influenced. Promote brands that you trust and like. <br>
              The brand will pay you a commission if a follower purchases a product through the code or link provided. TikTok does not allow personal accounts the ability to insert clickable links in video descriptions. You can still ask your followers to copy the links and paste them into their browsers or enter codes during checkout. You can create a free webpage containing affiliate links and product details using sites like Beacons. You can include a link to your business account in your bio. <br>
              Create an Affiliate Marketing Program that has clear guidelines on how to take part. TikTokers that align with your brand's values and audience are invited to participate. Encourage affiliates by encouraging them to promote products and services that align best with your shared goals and audience. Implement a tracking system to monitor affiliate performance. <br>
            </p> <br>
                <h3>6.	Sell TikTok accounts and grow your account.</h3> <br>
                <p>
                  It could take several months to grow a TikTok profile organically. You can purchase an existing account for an instant boost in followers.<br/>
                  Creators who want to make money by selling TikTok accounts should choose niche topics the buyer can sustain. The buyer can maintain engagement with the followers if they post similar content. <br>
                  Brands who are considering purchasing an established account must do their due diligence. A large number of followers but low engagement could not give you the return that you want. Also, ensure the account serves your target audience and that the content aligns with your brand and goals. <br>
                  Platforms like <a href="https://123accs.com/" target="_blank">123accs </a> <a target="_blank" href="https://legiit.com/Accfarm">Accfarm</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://fameswap.com/">Fameswap </a> allow brands to purchase accounts with active followers.<br>
                  Sales are focused on driving sales online, by phone, in-store, or
                   through an app. <br/>
                  Leads are where the goal is to generate leads by capturing their 
                  email addresses. <br/>
                  Website Traffic focuses on getting visitors to your website. <br/>
                  Brand and product consideration: Where you want people to learn 
                  more about your offerings
                  Brand recognition and reach are a priority that prioritizes brand
                   name recognition and impressions. <br/>
                  App Promotion is a way to promote your app by aiming to increase 
                  installs, registrations or interactions (these will usually be more
                   mobile-focused for obvious reasons). <br/>
                  Local Store Visits and Promotions, which focuses on getting customers
                   to visit you in a brick-and-mortar location. <br/>
                  If you're new to Google Ads, we don't recommend creating a campaign 
                  without a goal. Google will adjust the campaign settings based on 
                  your chosen objective. <br/>
                  Leads are often the priority for service-based businesses. SaaS 
                  companies will push for free trials. eCommerce businesses also want
                   to make sales as soon as possible. Google will consider this, so 
                   you should do any additional internal optimization.
                  In this example, because so many of our customers have an eCommerce 
                  focus, we will choose "Sales." <br/>
                </p> <br>
                <h3>7.	Post sponsored content</h3> <br>
                <p>You'll then choose the specific goals you want to emphasize in your 
                  campaign. <br/>
                  Brands can sponsor posts directly on the profiles of creators for smaller activations. These campaigns are similar to collaborations with creators. Brands can pay content creators for organic posts that promote their products. Sponsor a single post or create a whole series. You can boost a post if it becomes popular to increase its reach. <br/>
                  </p>
                  <h3>8.	Create a Patreon Account</h3> <br>
                  <p>A <a href="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank">Patreon</a> Account allows creators to generate revenue through fans by offering memberships that will enable exclusive content access. TikTok can be used to promote membership signups.
                    Consider rewarding new subscribers by lowering your subscription fees. You can give away exclusive content or merchandise to your most loyal fans. Add the Patreon link to your videos or your bio so your followers can subscribe to you whenever they want. <br>
                  </p> <br>
                  <h3>9.	Sell your products</h3> <br>
                  <p>Merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. The same tried-and-true strategy works for TikTok. TikTok is a great place to promote original artwork, quotes, or your logo. Showcase your products in tutorials or display them alongside a current trend.<br/>
                    If you're not sure what to sell, listen to your audience. Ask them directly or create polls to find out what they would buy. <br>
                    Create an ecommerce site to handle sales and promote it through your TikTok profile if you have a TikTok personal account. Add your store to your videos and encourage your viewers to look at your products. <br>
                    You can connect your TikTok business account to Shopify, BigCommerce and Ecwid platforms. <br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>10.	How to set up a TikTok store</h3> <br>
                    <p>TikTok and Shopify teamed up to launch the <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-discover-and-shop-on-tiktok" target="_blank">TikTok Shopping</a> feature. TikTok allows brands and creators to become merchants. They can sell their products directly within the app.<br/>
                      You can display products in the TikTok Shop on tabs for product showcase, live, and in-feed videos. You can become a TikTok seller if you are <a href="https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/university/essay?knowledge_id=7753799242893058&identity=1" target="_blank">eligible</a>.

                        TikTok released a new feature for monetization in June 2023, called <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-a-new-way-for-creators-to-share-premium-content-with-series" target="_blank">TikTok Series</a>.

                      </p> <br>
                      <h3>12.	Provide virtual gifts</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        Virtual gifts are another way to monetize your videos. Virtual gifts can be sent by people who enjoy your videos as a way to show their appreciation. These virtual gifts can then be turned into real money. <br>

                      <h3>13.	Organize live events and workshops.</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        TikTok Live offers another way to earn money. Users can send live gifts in a similar way to virtual video gifts. Users can tap the little gift box icon at the bottom of live videos to buy different gifts. These ranges are even more significant, some starting at a single penny and reaching tens of thousands. <br>

One creator earns between $20 and $300 every time they livestream, while another makes $34,000 monthly from live streaming. <br>

                      <h3>14.	Send personalized shoutouts</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        TikTokers may be willing to pay money for personalized shoutouts if you have a large audience. Set a price and sell shoutouts to earn money. You may have to experiment with your price. You can lower your price if you are not getting any bites. You can increase the price if you get a lot of interest in your product. <br>
                        Then, you can shout out these people during a video feed or a live video. You could even offer different prices (feed videos being more expensive) to allow users to choose where they want to be shouted. <br>

                      <h3>15.	Sell digital products</h3> <br>
                      <p>
                        Consider selling digital products. Create a TikTok shop and link your digital products there. This makes it easy to sell. Include your shop URL in your video and promote your products. <br>
